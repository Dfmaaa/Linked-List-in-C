# Linked-List-in-C
A linked list with a struct that has two fields, data, and pointer to next struct, that means you can go right, but not left, so no parent pointer. It allows you to delete a node at a position, insert a node at a position, see if a node exists. It's a pretty simple implementation, ignore the commented code.
